# old-stuff
Old video-games I coded back in 2011. All three are playable (or were at the time anyway).

Tetris : C and SDL (complete without score)

Snake : C and SDL (complete without score)

Ubiquit : C++ and SFML (you can only move and shoot bullets with no effect)

I used CodeBlocks at the time and followed "le site du zero" tutorials.
