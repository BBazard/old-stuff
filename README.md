# old-stuff
Old video-games I coded 4 years ago
all three are playable (were at the time anyway)

Tetris : C and SDL (complete without score)
Snake : C and SDL (complete without score)
Ubiquit : C++ and SFML (you can only move and shoot bullets with no effect)

I used CodeBlocks at the time and followed "le site du zero" tutorials.
